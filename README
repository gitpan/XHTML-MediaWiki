NAME
    XHTML::MediaWiki - Translate Wiki markup into xhtml

VERSION
    Version 0.06

SYNOPSIS
            use XHTML::MediaWiki;
            my $mediawiki = XHTML::MediaWiki->new();
            my $xhtm = $mediawiki->format($text);

DESCRIPTION
    <http://www.mediawiki.org/> and its sister projects use the PHP
    Mediawiki to format their pages. This module attempts to duplicate the
    Mediawiki formatting rules. Those formatting rules can be simple and
    easy to use, while providing more advanced options for the power user.

  Constructors
     new
        "new" takes several named parameters:

    link_path
        "link_path" is the "base" url to use.

  Methods
    reset_counters()
        call this method to reset the footnoot counter.

    get_block()
        If you would like to override the Block objects you can override
        this meathod.

    encode()
        You can override the enode function if you would like to change what
        is encoded. Currently only &, <, and > are encoded.

    emphasized()
        emphasized controls the output of "<em>" tags.

    link()
        The link method is often overridden to modify the dispaly and
        operation of links.

        link takes 3 arguments the Link, any extra_text, adn the type of the
        link;

        The type is true for footnotes.

    find_links()
        The find_links() method is also often overridden in order to change
        the way links are detected.

    template_text
        Override this method to control the text that is generated for an
        unknown template ({{word}}).

    format_line
        Override this method to extend or modify line level parsing.

    format()
        The format method is the only method that needs to be called for the
        normal operation of this object. You call format() with the raw
        *wikitext* and it returns the xhtml representation of that
        *wikitext*.
