NAME
    XHTML::MediaWiki - Translate Wiki markup into xhtml

SYNOPSIS
            use XHTML::MediaWiki;
            my $mediawiki = XHTML::MediaWiki->new( link_path => "http://example.com/base/" );
            my $xhtm = $mediawiki->format($text);

DESCRIPTION
    <http://www.mediawiki.org/> and its sister projects use the PHP
    Mediawiki to format their pages. This module attempts to duplicate the
    Mediawiki formatting rules. Those formatting rules can be simple and
    easy to use, while providing more advanced options for the power user.

  Constructors
    *   new( link_path => 'base path' )

        Create a new XHTML:;MediaWiki object. "link_path" is used as the
        base for hyperlinks.

  Methods
    *   format()

        The format method is the only method that needs to be called for the
        normal operation of this object. You call format() with the raw
        *wikitext* and it returns the xhtml representation of that
        *wikitext*.

    *   reset_counters()

        Call this method to reset the footnote counter.

  Overridable Methods
    The following methods can be overridden to change the functionality of
    the object.

    *   get_block()

        If you would like to override the Block objects you can override
        this method.

    *   encode()

        You can override the encode function if you would like to change
        what is encoded. Currently only &, <, and > are encoded.

    *   emphasized()

        emphasized controls the output of "<em>" tags.

    *   link()

        The link method is often overridden to modify the display and
        operation of links.

        link takes 3 arguments the Link, any extra_text, and the type of the
        link;

        The type is true for footnotes.

    *   find_links()

        The "find_links" method is also often overridden in order to change
        the way links are detected.

    *   template_text()

        Override this method to control the text that is generated for an
        unknown template ({{word}}).

    *   format_line()

        Override this method to extend or modify line level parsing.
